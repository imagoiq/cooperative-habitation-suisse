# üèòÔ∏è Swiss housing cooperative

Experimental project aimed at mapping and listing the housing cooperatives in Switzerland with a maximum of details.
This project does not aim at playing an intermediate or building new tool, but document and show what is possible, and what are the limitations.

From my research no such map exists across cantons. In Geneva, the Fondation pour la promotion du logement bon march√© et de l'habitat coop√©ratif (FPLC) provide a [map for the canton of Geneva](https://fplc.ch/cartes/cooperatives.htm).

## Use the data

At the moment, data can be viewed on [umap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/fr/map/cooperative-dhabitations-en-suisse_1140470).

- GeoJson
  - [Buildings](https://github.com/imagoiq/swiss-housing-cooperative/blob/main/output/swiss_housing_cooperative_buildings.geojson)
  - [Areas](https://github.com/imagoiq/swiss-housing-cooperative/blob/main/output/swiss_housing_cooperative_areas.geojson)
- TSV
  - [List of cooperative owners](https://github.com/imagoiq/swiss-housing-cooperative/blob/main/output/swiss_housing_cooperative_list_owners.tsv)
  - [List of cooperative operators](https://github.com/imagoiq/swiss-housing-cooperative/blob/main/output/swiss_housing_cooperative_list_operators.tsv)

## Contribute

All data comes directly from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org). If you're a beginner, you can learn to edit by reading [learnosm.org](https://learnosm.org/fr/) or ask for help.

## Schema

There is no pre-made or validated model specifically for housing cooperatives, but most of the proposed tags here are defined in the wiki of openstreetmap. Those from taginfo or my own imagination are declared on this page with \[tag de facto].

To target housing cooperatives, the query takes into account elements with the key `owner=*` and `operator=*` that are associated with `building|building:part|building:use=residential|apartments|dormitory|sheltered_housing`. This avoids associating building-related arts and cultural cooperatives (such as [Space Alliance Cooperative](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/38326020)). The filter will probably be refined in the future.
Note that sometimes the building is owned by a cooperative, sometimes it's not, and a cooperative manages the building, but the building belongs to a private company. The use of the two tags `operator` and `owner` makes it possible to identify these cases.

Neighborhoods founded entirely by a cooperative are also included in the data using the key `landuse=residential`. It's also a good idea to add tags to each building inside a neighborhood so that they can be counted, for example.

### Basic tags

- [`owner:type=cooperative`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/owner%3Atype=cooperative) \[tag de facto] or/and [`operator:type=cooperative`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:operator:type)

and either‚Ä¶

for Buildings:

- [`building=`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Buildings) or [`building:part=`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building:part) or [`building:use=`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building:use) with as value ¬†:
  - [`residential`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:building%3Dresidential) or prefer [`apartments`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:building%3Dapartments) for regular accommodation
  - [`dormitory`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:building%3Ddormitory) for student dormitory
  - [`sheltered_housing`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/building=sheltered_housing) \[tag de facto] for accommodation designated for older and/or disabled or other vulnerable people

for Neighborhood:

- [`name=`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:name) - name of the neighborhood
- [`landuse=residential`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:landuse%3Dresidential)
- [`residential=apartments`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:residential%3Dapartments)

### Enhance the metadata

#### Owner and/or operator

For the owner of the buildings:

- [`owner=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:owner) - Name
- [`owner:wikidata=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:operator#Further_details) - Wikidata ID
- [`owner:short=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:operator#Further_details) - Short name
- [`owner:abbr=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:operator#Further_details) - Abbreviation of the name

If the building is managed by a cooperative, another type of company or another cooperative:

- [`operator=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:operator) - Name
- [`operator:wikidata=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:operator#Further_details) - Wikidata ID
- [`operator:short=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:operator#Further_details) - Short name
- [`operator:abbr=*`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:operator#Further_details) - Abbreviation of the name

#### Buildings

- [`architect=`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:architect) - name of the architect who made the building
- [`start_date=`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:start_date) - date which indicate the end of the construction
- [`building:flats=`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building:flats) - number of flats in total (including cluster)
- [`building:flats:cluster`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/building%3Aflats%3Acluster) \[tag de facto] - number of cluster flats
- [`heating=gas|district_heating`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:heating) or other \[de facto] values [`heat_pump|oil|pellet|woodchip`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/heating#values) - Type of heating system

A bit more experimental:

- [`building:condition=renovated`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building:condition) - indicate that the building has been renovated
- [`renovated=`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/renovated) \[tag de facto] - date which indicate the end of the renovation
- [`renovated:architect=`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/renovated%3Aarchitect) \[tag de facto] - name of the architect who conducted the renovation

See also [the page Buildings on the wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building#Additional_attributes) to get even more tags.

#### Type of rents (experimental)

Housing cooperative are often made to create to add affordable housing on the market, but not always.
To distinguish buildings, there are currently no standard way in OpenStreetMap. From my research, [`subsidized=yes`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/subsidized) \[tag de facto] have been used 12 times (January 2025) which is not enough to make any generalization.

I propose some experimental tags to add below which are based on the concept of affordable housing in Switzerland and particularly in the Vaud region. I've not made enough research to know if this can be generalised and used in others countries.

In Switzerland, there are two kinds of affordable housing:

- Subsidized housing: the state give money for to build a new unit or renovate it. This has then impact to lower the rents. For this use case, I've used [`subsidized=yes`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/subsidized) \[tag de facto].
- Rent control/regulation: the state limits the amount of a rent (with various tools). This use case is a bit different as the first one, because it can apply on some flats within a building. I don't think we need to go at the level of counting flats at the moment. I propose to use [`rent:regulation=`](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/rent%3Aregulation) with `yes` or `only` to differentiate a building where all the flat have it or only some.

#### Miscellaneous

Very often, housing cooperatives have additional facilities:

- A common room. If this is public, it can be mapped via a separate node and
  - [`amenity=community_centre`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity%3Dcommunity_centre)
  - [`community_centre=community_hall`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:community_centre%3Dcommunity_hall)
  - [`community_centre:for=cooperative`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:community_centre:for)
- A shared vegetable garden.
  - [`leisure=garden`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:leisure=garden)
  - [`garden:style=kitchen`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:garden:style)
  - [`garden:type=community`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:garden:type)

## Technical Process

### Workflow

Here are the steps to build the GeoJson data:

1. Query Overpass API
1. Convert data to GeoJSOn with `osmtogeojson`
1. Add missing addresses with Nominatim API to ways in OpenStreetMap that aren't tagged with an address (e.g. when address is a separated node)

### Updates
